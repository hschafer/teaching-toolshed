# Teaching Tool Shed
A repository of helpful scripts, mostly Python, to help me run my large courses at the University of Washington. 

I can't promise a ton in terms of stability or flexibility of these scripts: I try out new things every quarter which require minor/major tweaks to these. Almost always I have one or more Jupyter Notebooks for the quarter to help me run and experiment with my analysis scripts for the quarter. These notebooks cannot be shared generally since they contain student data, so this repo will show some of the most useful fragments I've developed for these notebooks.

In terms of structure, there are various sub-folders for different discrete tasks. Check out the READMEs in the sub-folders for more info! 

Any questions or comments can be handled here on GitHub or you can email me at [hschafer@cs.washington.edu](mailto:hschafer@cs.washington.edu).

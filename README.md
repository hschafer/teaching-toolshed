# Teaching Tool Shed
A repository of helpful scripts, mostly Python, to help me run my large courses at the University of Washington.

I can't promise a ton in terms of stability or flexibility of these scripts: I try out new things every quarter which require minor/major tweaks to these. Almost always I have one or more Jupyter Notebooks for the quarter to help me run and experiment with my analysis scripts for the quarter. These notebooks cannot be shared generally since they contain student data, so this repo will show some of the most useful fragments I've developed for these notebooks.

Any questions or comments can be handled here on GitHub or you can email me at [hschafer@cs.washington.edu](mailto:hschafer@cs.washington.edu).

## Project Structure
Many of the top-level files are independent Python scripts to complete various tasks. The `teachingtoolshed` directory defines modules and packages for many utility classes.
